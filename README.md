# MLFlow and DagsHub Experiment Tracking

This repository is a demonstration of how to use MLFlow and DagsHub for experiment tracking.

## MLFlow

MLflow is an open-source tool to manage the machine learning lifecycle. It supports live logging of parameters, metrics, metadata, and artifacts when running a machine learning experiment. To manage the post training stage, it provides a model registry with deployment functionality to custom serving tools.

## DagsHub

DagsHub provides a free hosted MLflow server with team-based access control for every repository. You can log experiments with MLflow to it, view its information under the experiment tab, and manage your trained models from the full-fledged MLflow UI built into your DagsHub project.

Find more information about DagsHub and MLFlow in the [DagsHub Docs](https://dagshub.com/docs/integration_guide/mlflow_tracking/).
